          <h2>Learning plan</h2>

          <p>
            I decided to join this Bootcamp to switch career. I was working as
            an ECE teacher and It was definitely a great experience, where I
            could learn a lot from my coworkers and also from the kids. But at
            certain point I realized it was time to go out of my comfort zone
            and try something new.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started studying programming in January but at a very slow pace.
            So when I heard about this course I thought it could be a great
            opportunity to learn faster and also to give me the motivation I
            needed to keep going.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of my strengths in relation to learning is focus and
            organization. During foundations I've been using a weekly plan to
            guide me through all the tasks that needs to be done.
          </p>
          <img
            class="article-img"
            src="/imgs/weekly plan.png"
            alt="weekly plan"
          />

          <p>
            I expect that until the end of this course I can improve the skills
            I already have and also gain new ones, such as, effective
            communication and critical thinking.
          </p>

          <p>
            I know that this will be a short but a intense learning journey. So,
            in order to keep my mind healthy I will try my best to remember to
            always be kind with myself and also to respect my limitations.
          </p>

          <p>
            And hopefully I will get my first job and eventually be able to work
            remotely and have more time to go visit my family in Brazil.
          </p>

          <h2>Reflections</h2>
          <div class="reflection-container">
            <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>
              It would be amazing if I can work with something I enjoy but my
              main long term goal is to be able to have more flexibility while
              working. This way I could go back to Brazil and spend more time
              with my family.
            </p>
            <h3>
              What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be
              in Bootcamp?
            </h3>
            <p>
              I think my main strength is the ability to keep focus on what I am
              learning. On the other hand, I imagine that the learning pace is
              very fast during Bootcamp, so I might feel overwhelmed by that.
            </p>
            <h3>
              What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
              will be?
            </h3>
            <p>
              I consider myself a shy person, so it will be challenging to speak
              in front of others.
            </p>

            <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
            <p>
              I hope the Bootcamp team can helps us create a enjoyable learning
              environment and guide us through all the challenges we might have.
            </p>
            <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>
              I hope by the end of this Bootcamp I can feel more confident with
              my communication and technical skills.
