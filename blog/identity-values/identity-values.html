          <h2>Identity</h2>
          <p>
            For this challenge I had to do a lot of reflection about myself and
            about how others see me. It is not always easy to put into words who
            you are and what defines you.
          </p>
          <p>
            To begin with, I think what really defines my identity is my
            cultural background. I was born and raised in Brazil but my
            grandparents,from both sides, are from Japan. So, I guess I built my
            personality from that.
          </p>
          <p>
            And just so you know, Brazil is home to the largest Japanese
            community outside of Japan. At the time, japanese people were trying
            to flee the Second War and that's how my grandparents ended up in
            Rio de Janeiro.
          </p>

          <h2>Values and Strengths</h2>
          <p>
            Regarding the construction of my values and strengths, my family
            played a very important role. They were responsible to teach me most
            of my values, such as, respect, empathy, discipline and gratitude.
          </p>
          <p>
            My parents are buddhists and some values I also got from there.
            Buddhists believes in Karma, which basically means that every action
            has a consequence. So do good and good will come to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            That all being said, I consider myself a honest, patient and
            organized person. On the other hand I am not a confident and an
            extroverted person, so I tend to feel easily overwhelmed and that
            could possibly be an obstacle in regards my learning.
          </p>

          <p>
            I truly hope my values and strengths can help me overcome my
            limitations throughout this course.
