          <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p>
            Our brain is not a static organ of our body, it is in fact very
            dynamic and powerful. It can grow and create new neurons connections
            everyday. Neuroplasticity is the science behind all that, and in
            simple terms, it means that our brain is capable to adapt and
            develop new skills and knowledge through effort and practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carol Dweck, an American psychologist, made an experiment to
            understand how the principle of neuroplasticity can benefits people
            of all ages. According to her studies there is two types of
            mindsets, the fixed and the growth mindset.
          </p>

          <h2>Fixed Mindset VS. Growth Mindset</h2>
          <img
            class="article-img"
            src="/imgs/mindset.jpg"
            alt="fixed vs growth mindset"
          />
          <p>
            In a fixed mindset human traits like intelligence and personality
            are seen as something you cannot change. This mindset can lead you
            to an extreme fear of failure and as a consequence, it will make you
            avoid challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            People with a fixed mindset feel as if they have no control over
            their abilities, and simply do not know how to behave when facing
            difficulties. This thoughts can make you develop low self-esteem.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the other hand, people with a growth mindset believes that you
            can improve and develop new skills if you put effort and keep
            practicing everyday. It is hard to believe, but according to Carol’s
            experiment she proved that the students who knew that our brain is
            constantly evolving and its capable to learn and adapt; had a better
            performance at school when compared with the students who doesn't
            know anything about the benefits of Neuroplasticity.
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            At this point you already know how hard it is to learn programming,
            so it is easy to feel incompetent and scared. It is a normal feeling
            but it won't help you achieve the main goal here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course it will take time to be really good at it, but with effort
            and lots of practice your brain will create the necessary
            connections to help you improve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Going through a coding Bootcamp definitely requires a growth mindset
            to help you deal with all the challenges and obstacles than can come
            up on the way. For that reason I believe it is important to
            understand that failure is inevitable and you can learn a lot from
            them. It might sound silly but changing your beliefs can have a
            powerful impact in your brain.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a variety of activities that you can practice to help you
            create these brain connections, such as, play games, learn another
            language or play an instrument.
