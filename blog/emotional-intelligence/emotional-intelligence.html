          <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize and understand
            not only your own emotions but also help you perceive how the others
            around you are feeling as well. It is a good practice to better
            manage these emotions in order to overcome future challenges.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dan Goleman is a psychologist who was responsible for turning the
            concept of emotional intelligence popular with his book
            <em>Emotional Intelligence</em> in 1996.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to Goleman there are 5 component's that help you improve
            your emotional intelligence:
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-heading">Self awareness</h3>
          <p>
            Self awareness is all about learning to better understand your
            emotions and thoughts and what actions you can take to better manage
            these emotions and the effect they have on you.
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-heading">Self regulation</h3>
          <p>
            Self regulation is about staying in control of the situation. You
            need first understand who you are and how do you behave when facing
            a challenge. This will help you regulate reactions to strong
            emotions, such as, anger and frustration.
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-heading">Motivations</h3>
          <p>
            Self motivation is definitely not an easy skill to put in practice.
            So, specially if you are learning something new by yourself you
            gotta need some guidance to help you stay motivated.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, what really helps me stay motivated is to keep my goals
            clear. So this way I can kind of "trick" my brain to believe that
            even though the path is hard I will eventually achieve my goals if I
            don't give up.
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-heading">Empathy</h3>
          <p>
            Empathy is the ability to understand the other people's emotions and
            thoughts. This skill helps us build strong relationships once we can
            truly understand the angsts of those around us.
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-heading">Social skills</h3>
          <p>
            In order to improve your social skills you need to reflect on how do
            you usually resolve the conflicts in your life, how can you motivate
            others around you and also how can you improve your communication
            skills when interacting with someone.
          </p>
          <h2>EQ VS IQ</h2>
          <p>
            IQ is the intelligence quotient and measures your ability to use
            logic to solve a problem. It is related to the rational part of your
            brain.
          </p>
          <p>
            IQ is an important skill to have but the experts in this field
            recognize that EQ should have more attention because it can
            interfere in your social interactions and your daily routine.
