          <h2>Hello world</h2>
          <p>
            First of all, I am glad that we all made to the second week. Well
            done! That is certainly a victory already.
          </p>

          <p>
            I decided to join this Bootcamp to switch career. I was working as
            an ECE teacher and It was definitely a great experience, where I
            could learn a lot from my coworkers and also from the kids. But at
            certain point I realized it was time to go out of my comfort zone
            and try something new.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started studying programming in January but at a very slow pace.
            So when I heard about this Bootcamp I thought it could be a great
            opportunity to learn faster and also to give me the motivation I
            needed to keep going.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of my strengths in relation to learning is focus and
            organization. During foundations I've been using a weekly plan to
            guide me through all the tasks it needs to be done.
          </p>

            alt="weekly plan"
          />

          <p>
            I expect that until the end of this course I can improve the skills
            I already have and also gain new ones, such as, effective
            communication and critical thinking.
          </p>

          <p>
            I know that this will be a short but a intense learning journey and
            I tend to feel easily overwhelmed. So, in order to keep my mind
            healthy I will try my best to remember to always be kind with myself
            and also to respect my limitations.
          </p>

          <p>
            And hopefully I will get my first job and eventually be able to work
            remotely and have more time to go visit my family in Brazil. I miss
            them a lot!
