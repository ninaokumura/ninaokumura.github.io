              What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your
              ego as a result of the core learning?
            </h3>
            <p>1 - It is possible to overcome my fears and achieve my goals.</p>

            <p>
              2 - Taking more time for self reflections helped me better
              understand myself.
            </p>
            <p>3 - Improve my self confidence and my communication skills.</p>

            <h3>
              What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in
              learning and programming?
            </h3>

            <p>
              Learning programming is hard, so it is nice to have a safe
              learning environment, where we can all feel comfortable to speak,
              to give and receive feedback and be ourselves. Empathy and self
              awareness are part of what makes the process of learning more
              enjoyable and rewarding.
            </p>

            <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
            <p>
              I loved to learn more about how neuroplasticity works and its
              benefits. It was my favorite content of the core section.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
              time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp
              course?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Because technical skills are not the only thing that matters. We
              connect with other people every single day. Understanding these
              concepts helps us grow in our professional and personal life,
              improving our relationships. Specially during these hard times,
              where we are all more fragile, it is essential to develop soft
              skills.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
              waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising
              programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </h3>
            <p>
              It definitely wasn't a waste of time, even though it takes hours
              for me to write a blog article. I had a few moments where I was
              doubting myself and the content helped me to get back on track,
              kind of switching my thoughts to a more positive way.
