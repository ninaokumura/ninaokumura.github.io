          <h2>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h2>

          <p> 
            These three technologies work together to create beautiful and
            dynamic web applications.
            
            HTML stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em> and is responsible for all the content of the user interface, such as,
            buttons, paragraphs,images and text.
            
            CSS stands for <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em> and with this tool we can create beautiful webpages, because CSS gives you the power to style all the content. 
                       
            And last but not least, JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to add
            interactive effects and functionalities to the webpage.
          </p>
               
            
            <img class="article-img" src="/imgs/JSVenDiagram.png" />

            <p>To have a better comprehension of what all that means, let's think about the human body.</p>
             <img class="article-img" src="/imgs/analogy.jpeg" alt="analogy"/>
             <p>So in this analogy, HTML would be the structure of the body. CSS would be our appearance, like our clothes and hair color for example. Now JavaScript would be our nervous system and muscles. It gives everything movement and dynamic abilities.</p>

             <h2>Control flow and Loops</h2>
             <h2>DOM</h2>
             <p>DOM stands for <em>document object model</em> and it is a structured representation of HTML documents. It allows JavaScript to access HTML elements and styles in order to manipulate them in complex ways.</p>
             <p>
               The DOM is not part of JavaScript, it is actually part of something called web API's.
               And API's are like libraries that the browser implement and we can access using JavaScript.
              </p>
               <h2>Arrays vs Objects</h2>
               <p>Arrays and Objects are data structures, which is a collection of data values.</p>
               <p>Arrays behave like a big container and it can hold as many values as you want. It can also accept values of any type.</p>
               <p>Arrays are zero based, and this basically means that the first item of an array is at the position zero. So if you want to retrieve an element in the array you need to specify the index position and you can do this using the <em>bracket notation.</em></p>
               <img class="article-img img-size" src="/imgs/array-example.png"/>

               <p>Now, just like <em>arrays</em>, <em>objects</em> are used to essentially group different variables that really belong together. The big difference between them, is that in <em>objects</em> the order of these values does not matter at all when you want to access them. </p>

               <p>There is two ways to retrieve an element in a <em>object</em> you can use either <em>bracket notation</em> or <em>dot notation.</em> </p>
               <img class="article-img img-size" src="/imgs/object-example.png"/>
