          <h2>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h2>

          <p> 
            These three technologies work together to create beautiful and
            dynamic web applications.
            
            HTML stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em> and is responsible for all the content of the user interface, such as,
            buttons, paragraphs,images and text.
            
            CSS stands for <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em> and with this tool we can create beautiful webpages, because CSS gives you the power to style all the content. 
                       
            And last but not least, JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to add
            interactive effects and functionalities to the webpage.
          </p>
               
            
            <img class="img-size" src="/imgs/JSVenDiagram.png" />

            <p>To have a better comprehension of what all that means, let's think about the human body.</p>
             <img class="img-size" src="/imgs/analogy.jpeg" alt="analogy"/>
             <p>So in this analogy, HTML would be the structure of the body. CSS would be our appearance, like our clothes and hair color for example. Now JavaScript would be our nervous system and muscles. It gives everything movement and dynamic abilities.</p>

             <h2>Control flow and Loops</h2>
             <p>Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line to the last line in the file, unless the computer runs across structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. </p>
             <p>Loops are a fundamental part of JavaScript language, they are used to automate repetitive tasks based on a certain condition.</p>
             

             <h2>DOM</h2>
             <p>DOM stands for <em>Document Object Model</em> and it is a structured representation of HTML documents. It allows JavaScript to access HTML elements and styles in order to manipulate them in complex ways.</p>
             <p>
               The DOM is not part of JavaScript, it is actually part of something called web API's.
               And API's are like libraries that the browser implement and we can then access using JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>There are different ways to access an HTML element using DOM. Below is a simple example of one of them.</p>
            <img class="article-img" src="/imgs/querySelector-example.png"/>
            <p>In the example above I used the <em>"document.querySelector()"</em> method to change the font color of the paragraph. You can notice two things:</p>
                          
                <p> 1 - In order to access the <em>class = "bestRecords"</em> I used the <em>dot</em> before the class name. In case you want to access an <em>id</em> just use <em>hashtag</em> instead of <em>dot</em>.</p>

                <p> 2 - The <em>class = "bestRecords"</em> is placed in all the paragraphs but it only changed the style of the first one. And that's how this selector should work. If you need to manipulate all the paragraphs you can use the <em>"document.querySelectorAll()"</em>.</p>
                         
              
               <h2>Arrays vs Objects</h2>
               <p>Arrays and Objects are data structures, which is a collection of data values.</p>
               <p>Arrays behave like a big container and it can hold as many values as you want. It can also accept values of any type.</p>
               <p>Arrays are zero based, and this basically means that the first item of an array is at the position zero. So if you want to retrieve an element in the array you need to specify the index position and you can do this by using <em>bracket notation.</em></p>

               <img class="article-img" src="/imgs/array-example.png"/>

               <p>Now, just like <em>arrays</em>, <em>objects</em> are used to essentially group different variables that really belong together. The big difference between them, is that in <em>objects</em> the order of these values does not matter at all when you want to access them. </p>

               <p>There is two ways to retrieve an element in a <em>object</em>. You can use either <em>bracket notation</em> or <em>dot notation.</em> </p>
               <img class="article-img" src="/imgs/object-example.png"/>

             <h2>Function</h2>
             <p><em>Function</em> is a piece of code that not only allows you to reuse the same code over and over again but it can also receive data and return data back.</p>
             <p>There's three different ways of writing functions: <em>function declaration</em>, <em>function expression</em> and <em>arrow function</em>. The following image is an example of <em>function declaration</em>.</p>
             
             <img class="article-img " src="/imgs/function-example.png"/>
             
             <p>In <em>functions</em> you have to specify something called parameter, which will be defined once the <em>function</em> is called.
            In the example above, the parameter is the <em>birthYear</em>.</p>
