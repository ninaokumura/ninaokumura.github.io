          <h2>Emotional Intelligence vs</h2>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize and understand
            not only your own emotions but also helps to perceive how the others
            around you are feeling as well. It is a good practice to better
            manage these emotions in order to overcome future challenges.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dan Goleman is a psychologist who is responsible for turning the
            concept of emotional intelligence popular with his book
            <em>Emotional Intelligence</em> in 1996.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to Goleman there are 5 component's to help you improve
            your emotional intelligence:

            <!-- What is Emotional Intelligence? How is it different to IQ? Why is it
          important? -->
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-heading">Self awareness</h3>
          <p>
            Self awareness is all about learning to better understand your
            emotions and thoughts. Once we can fully understand what is going on
            in our lives we can then start making some improvements to control
            these emotions instead of let them control us.
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-heading">Self regulation</h3>
          <p>
            Self regulation is about staying in control of the situation. You
            need first understand who you are and how do you behave when facing
            a challenge. It is a good practice if you want your mind to be more
            calm.
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-heading">Motivations</h3>
          <p>
            Self motivation is definitely not an easy skill to put in practice.
            We are all humans and of course we have our struggles, so specially
            if you are learning something new by yourself you gotta need some
            guidance to help you to stay on track.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, what really helps me stay motivated is to keep my goals
            clear. So this way I can kind of "trick" my brain to believe that
            even though the path is hard I will eventually achieve my goals if I
            don't give up.
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-heading">Empathy</h3>
          <p>
            Empathy is the ability to understand the other people's emotions and
            thoughts. This skill helps us build strong relationships once we can
            truly understand the angsts of those around us.
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-heading">Social skills</h3>
          <p>
            In order to have a good social skills you need to reflect on how do
            you usually resolve the conflicts in your life, how can you motivate
            others around you and also how can you improve your communication
            skills in social situations.
          </p>
          <p>
            So emotional intelligence can helps us be more aware of everything
            that surround us and can also help us to become better humans.
